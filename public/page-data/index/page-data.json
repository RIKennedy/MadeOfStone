After working on this project for over 2 years I decided it was finally time to start showing people what I've been working on. This is the place I'll be sharing information on the progress, thoughts, ideas, and struggles I'm having during development of this game. In addition to this website I also decided to create a business called <a href=\"https://www.ElytraGames.com\">Elytra Games</a> with the hope that one day it will be more than just me working on this game or future projects.</p>\n<br>\n<h4>A little about me</h4>\n<p>While growing up in Minnesota I always had a passion for nature, animals and ecology. After graduating high school I went to a small college in Durango, Colorado called Fort Lewis where I received a bachelors degree in environmental biology hoping to work outside protecting the environment and wildlife. After a few years of seasonal work, I discovered that the majority of jobs that I wanted were either seasonal, extremely hard to get, or funded by large companies that were responsible for destroying the environment. After being fed up with these aspects of biology work and not finding a great job I had to get out and find a full time steady job. I worked for years in restaurants, grocery stores, and in retail where I learned plenty of great skills and made decent money but ultimately it was stressful, unfulfilling and just wasn't for me. A few years ago I was extremely fortunate to have the opportunity to change careers and try to do something that I love. I've had a passion for video games my entire life and I decided to start learning game development. I was immediately hooked. I had zero experience with programming, 3D art, animation or graphic art so I started with some classes on <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com\">Udemy</a> to see what aspects of game dev that I liked and what I'm good at. After making a bunch of small games during those courses I really enjoyed all aspects of game development and decided it was time to take on a bigger project to add to my resume.</p>\n<br>\n<h4>Why I started this game</h4>\n<p>I've played so many games in my lifetime and as a biologist it has always bothered me that animals or creatures in video games are almost always just target practice and rarely have any depth. Its hard to find a game where creatures interact with each other, the environment, or are helpful for anything. My dream is to create games with creatures that have depth, they interact with the environment, they interact with each other and have complex behaviors. This is my first game with the goal of trying to achieve some of these aspects.</p>\n<br>\n<h4>About the game</h4>\n<p>Made of Stone is a PC open-world crafting survival game set in the Paleolithic Era where you can build a home, farm, and tame creatures to help you along the way. The goal is to survive, gear up, and kill a sabretooth tiger. You can learn more about the premise in the about section of the main page.</p>\n<br>","frontmatter":{"brand":null,"anchor":null,"clients":null,"content":null,"copyright":null,"header":null,"email":null,"imageFileName":"devlogpost/devlog-1/banner.png","jumpToAnchor":null,"jumpToAnchorText":null,"menuText":null,"portfolios":null,"privacyHref":null,"privacyText":null,"services":null,"social":null,"subheader":null,"screenshots":null,"videos":null,"teamMember":null,"termsHref":null,"termsText":null,"title":"Devlog 1 - Welcome"},"fields":{"fileName":"1-Welcome","directoryName":"Devlog 1"}},{"html":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1080px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/221d515cc00691efd8e378859ab0d807/43b85/banner.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 13.333333333333334%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"image1\"\n        title=\"image1\"\n        src=\"/static/221d515cc00691efd8e378859ab0d807/797d6/banner.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/221d515cc00691efd8e378859ab0d807/71762/banner.jpg 270w,\n/static/221d515cc00691efd8e378859ab0d807/db81d/banner.jpg 540w,\n/static/221d515cc00691efd8e378859ab0d807/797d6/banner.jpg 1080w,\n/static/221d515cc00691efd8e378859ab0d807/4d155/banner.jpg 1620w,\n/static/221d515cc00691efd8e378859ab0d807/43b85/banner.jpg 1856w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<h3>Workflow</h3>\n<br>\n<h6>Unity</h6>\n<p>I'm creating this game programming in C# and using the Unity Game engine. I've decided to use Unity because of its ease of entry, and because it has a lot of documentation for me to trouble shoot problems. I also prefer its interface over Unreal and since I'm still learning how to build games and I'm new to programming, I knew I couldn't build the game engine by myself. </p>\n<br>\n<h6>Blender</h6>\n<p>I'm using Blender to create my 3D assets mainly because it's free. At this point I've had absolutely zero funding and spending hundreds on Maya or other programs just wasn't in the cards. Also, Blender has come a long way and I find it to be sufficient for everything I need it for, 3D creation, rigging and animations are all being done in Blender</p>\n<br>\n<h6>GIMP</h6>\n<p>I'm using GIMP for 2D image manipulation mainly because it's also free. It's not entirely intuitive and the interface isn't great but find it adequate for just about everything I need it to do. I may end up buying a license to use Adobe products and photoshop but at this point I just haven't needed it.</p>\n<br>\n<h6>Inkscape</h6>\n<p>Most of my icons and user interface have been created with Inkscape. I like Inkscape because it allows me to create vector graphics that can easily be resized without any loss in quality. It does have some issues and is a bit buggy but again, it's free and has been a great tool for everything I've needed it for.</p>\n<br>\n<h6>Other tools</h6>\n<p>I've been using Asana (like Trello) to keep track of my development and to get all my ideas and tasks \"on paper\". I like Mindmeister to brainstorm ideas and figure out how the gameplay will work out. I use Github for source control. Lastly I've used Udemy to learn all sorts of thing and I highly suggest it as a resource for people new to game development.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3>Systems</h3>\n<br>\n<p>I started making this game by creating the base systems to create the terrain and to place items. Since I'm currently just a one man team I knew it was important to create a procedurally generated world so I could create a huge world without placing everything by hand. These systems are subject to change and in the next weeks, months and maybe years I will probably be going over these systems in more detail but this is the basics.</p>\n<br>\n<h5>World Generation</h5>\n<p>I've created a basically endless world that loads and unloads in chunks depending on the location of the player. To create the terrain I'm using a cellular noise map to randomly decide where to place each biome. Then I use a value fractal noise map within each biome to place a variety of tile shapes and a random number generator to rotate each tile to create variation within each biome. I also have a variety of colors that the tile can be rendered in to add even more variety. I originally was using a Perlin noise map but I found the cellular and value fractal noise to give me better load times and a bit more of the look I wanted. I currently have 4 biomes, swamp, desert, rock and grass but I can add as many biomes as I want over time. These are the shapes that I've created for the biomes, I've adjusted the look of these shapes several times and I will probably continue to iterate on them until I get the look I'm happy with. The octagon in the center of each tile is just a guide to make sure the tile will work at any rotation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/b57e0f44765c1f6002e905ad8fe4a4af/43a26/tiles.jpg\" \nalt=\"Biome Tiles\"\ntitle=\"Biome Tile Variations\" \nonclick=\"window.open('/static/b57e0f44765c1f6002e905ad8fe4a4af/43a26/tiles.jpg', '_blank');\"\nstyle=\"width:265px; height:230px; padding:15px; display:inline; cursor: pointer;\" />\n<img src=\"/static/6033cfeb540dd66a7cb03acce34993d4/b07f6/tiletest1.jpg\" \nalt=\"Biome Transition 1\"\ntitle=\"Biome Transition Example 1\"\nonclick=\"window.open('/static/6033cfeb540dd66a7cb03acce34993d4/b07f6/tiletest1.jpg', '_blank');\"\nstyle=\"width:265px; height:230px; padding:15px; display:inline; cursor: pointer;\" />\n<img src=\"/static/dfdfc17b99ea77393b15b1b4a01d7eec/727ae/tiletest2.jpg\" \nalt=\"Biome Transition 2\" \ntitle=\"Biome Transition Example 2\" \nonclick=\"window.open('/static/dfdfc17b99ea77393b15b1b4a01d7eec/727ae/tiletest2.jpg', '_blank');\"\nstyle=\"width:265px; height:230px; padding:15px; display:inline; cursor: pointer;\" />\n<img src=\"/static/79b2a0eccbde2ccad61b9c1aa074658b/10469/tiletest3.jpg\" \nalt=\"Biome Transition 3\" \ntitle=\"Biome Transition Example 3\" \nonclick=\"window.open('/static/79b2a0eccbde2ccad61b9c1aa074658b/10469/tiletest3.jpg', '_blank');\"\nstyle=\"width:265px; height:230px; padding:15px; display:inline; cursor: pointer;\" /></p>\n<br>\n<h5>Item placement</h5>\n<p>Items are randomly placed in the world depending on the biome and rarity of the item. Most items are only found in certain biomes and I created a system to place the items according to a Unity scriptable object. This gives me a menu for each item I add so I can choose a biome or multiple biomes and a rarity level. When the game loads each item is given a random spawn number and each tile is also given a random spawn number, between 1-10,000. Items that have a rarity of 1 are given a single spawn number, items with a rarity of 2 are given 2 random spawn numbers, rarity 3 have 3 spawn numbers, and so on till rarity 100 which are given 100 spawn numbers. Then if the items spawn number matches the tile spawn number, the item is given a random rotation and then is spawned there. This means a rare item has a 1/10,000 chance to spawn and a common item has a 1/100 chance to spawn. These numbers may seem low but each chunk contains 100 tiles and the world currently generates 7 chunks (this is adjustable) in the distance so the player can see several thousand tiles at a time.</p>\n<br>\n<h5>Adding more items to the game</h5>\n<p>During development I will be adding a lot of items to the game. I've streamlined the process of adding items and recipes to the game through Unity scriptable objects. When I'm adding a new item, all I need to do is add a new scriptable object and in the inspector give the item a number, drag in a prefab for the 3D model, and choose the items attributes like is it edible, wearable, pickup-able, can it stack, does it have any crafting recipes and so on. This makes it really easy to add anything I want to the game without having to do any programming.</p>\n<br>\n<h5>Creatures</h5>\n<p>I have many goals when it comes to the creatures of this game and I believe that this is the biggest differentiator to other crafting and survival games and will really make this game unique. I would like to create a system to allow the player to tame all the creatures of this game and have them help you during your playthrough. I would like to create a unique system where you will need to feed the creature its favorite food without scaring it off and then pet them once or maybe multiple times before a creature becomes your friend. Once they are your friend they will be helpful in many ways, they may follow and protect you, carry items, do work in farms or automate tasks around your home. Think of the Flintstones where the creatures did all sorts of tasks. It's an ambitious goal but I think this will really make this game fun and provide a lot of interesting gameplay.</p>\n<br>","frontmatter":{"brand":null,"anchor":null,"clients":null,"content":null,"copyright":null,"header":null,"email":null,"imageFileName":"devlogpost/devlog 2/banner.jpg","jumpToAnchor":null,"jumpToAnchorText":null,"menuText":null,"portfolios":null,"privacyHref":null,"privacyText":null,"services":null,"social":null,"subheader":null,"screenshots":null,"videos":null,"teamMember":null,"termsHref":null,"termsText":null,"title":"Devlog 2 - Workflow and Systems"},"fields":{"fileName":"2-WhereImAt","directoryName":"Devlog 2"}},{"html":"","frontmatter":{"brand":null,"anchor":null,"clients":null,"content":null,"copyright":"Copyright © Elytra Games 2020","header":null,"email":null,"imageFileName":null,"jumpToAnchor":null,"jumpToAnchorText":null,"menuText":null,"portfolios":null,"privacyHref":"#!","privacyText":"Privacy Policy","services":null,"social":{"facebook":"#","github":null,"linkedin":null,"medium":"#","twitter":"#","instagram":null,"youtube":null,"discord":null},"subheader":null,"screenshots":null,"videos":null,"teamMember":null,"termsHref":"#!","termsText":"Terms of Use","title":""},"fields":{"fileName":"Footer.en","directoryName":"content"}},{"html":"","frontmatter":{"brand":"Made From Stone","anchor":null,"clients":null,"content":null,"copyright":null,"header":null,"email":null,"imageFileName":null,"jumpToAnchor":null,"jumpToAnchorText":null,"menuText":"Menu ","portfolios":null,"privacyHref":null,"privacyText":null,"services":null,"social":null,"subheader":null,"screenshots":null,"videos":null,"teamMember":null,"termsHref":null,"termsText":null,"title":""},"fields":{"fileName":"NavBar.en","directoryName":"content"}},{"html":"","frontmatter":{"brand":null,"anchor":null,"clients":null,"content":null,"copyright":null,"header":"Made From Stone","email":null,"imageFileName":"top.jpg","jumpToAnchor":"Services","jumpToAnchorText":"Tell Me More","menuText":null,"portfolios":null,"privacyHref":null,"privacyText":null,"services":null,"social":null,"subheader":"Welcome to","screenshots":null,"videos":null,"teamMember":null,"termsHref":null,"termsText":null,"title":""},"fields":{"fileName":"Top.en","directoryName":"content"}},{"html":"<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Craft</strong> hundreads of items to help you on your way</li>\n<li><strong>Farm</strong> many different plants for a balenced diet</li>\n<li><strong>Build</strong> a home for protection and storing your items</li>\n<li><strong>Tame</strong> wild creatures to help out around the house</li>\n<li><strong>Explore</strong> an endless procedurally generated wilderness</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sandbox / Building / Management <br>\n<strong>Platforms:</strong> PC - May support others in the future <br>\n<strong>Supported Languages:</strong> The goal of this game is to have no language present, only icons <br>\n<strong>Created By:</strong> Ryan Kennedy at <a title=\"Elytra Games Link\" href=\"#\">Elytra Games</a> <br>\n<strong>What makes this game unique:</strong> Tame the creatures of the wild to help and automate tasks <br>\n<strong>Related Games:</strong> Don't Starve, One Hour One Life, Minecraft, The Forest, Rimworld, Astroneer, Factorio, Green Hell <br>\n<strong>Inspiration:</strong> The Flintstones, The Croods, How to Train Your Dragon <br>\n<strong>Development Started:</strong> January 2018 <br>\n<strong>Release Date:</strong> TBD <br>\n<strong>Game Engine:</strong> Unity <br>\n<strong>Programming Language:</strong> C# <br></p>","frontmatter":{"brand":null,"anchor":"About","clients":null,"content":"Made From Stone is a game about a boy becoming a man during the stoneage.
